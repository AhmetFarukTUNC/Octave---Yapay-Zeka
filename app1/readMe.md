# First,we created diagonal matrix with A = eye(5) command.

# We drawed graphic according to profit margin of city population.

# We calculated cost function and found optimal result.

# We used gradient descent algorithm and found training data.

# We drawed graphic of training data as linear.

# AI model did predict.

# We drawed surface and contour graphics for theta0 and theta1.
